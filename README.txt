How to run:
Precompiled:
 - go to directory jar/ and run service_std.jar for non-dispatching service. Run jar with argument 'server' or 'client', or without argument to start automatically as server.

- run jar/service_dispatcher.jar with arguments 'client', 'server', or 'dispatcher' (dispatcher has to be started first, then server, then clients..)

Compiling:
- import project into eclipse
- in Application.java set flag USE_DISPATCHER to true or false (depending on use)
- export Runnable Jar file from eclipse.
- run jar file as explained in (Precompiled) section.
